### This is the main repository of the challenge to apply to the Analytics Engineering Position in Stori


This challenge was solved with a notebook in Google Colaboratory

At the same time the sql queries that I wrote to ask some questions are in this repository.

## Tools, software and programming language used on this challenge
I used several tools in order to solve this challenge.
### Diagrams and Flow Charts.
In order to create the the diagram I used [dbdiagram](https://dbdiagram.io/home) as the main tool, the flow chart that corresponds to the DAG diagram was made with [Lucidchart](https://lucid.app)

### Programming Language
All the data extraction, manipulation and loading were made with Python.

### Database
I used MySQL as the dialect to create the databases at the same time the database is located in [Aiven](https://aiven.io/) that is an online provider of databases and has a free plan.

### Notebook
All the code, the SQL connection, the query execution, the UML process, the data dictionary and the DAG were located in a Notebook, I used the Google Colaboratory tool in order to make this challenge.
